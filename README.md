# Project History
- Shuwa came to be through the Agile Software Development & DevOps class for Fall 2025. Our team completed a project proposal to work on for the entire semester, the outcome of that being Shuwa. We also wanted to build a sign language interpreter for the sake of accessibility. A person who understands sign language and can readily translate it is not always available. So, by using Shuwa, anyone can translate sign language to text.
